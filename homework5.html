		<p class="parastatement"> I added the Hazmat symbol repeated and layered over itself in red and black multiple times throughout the photo collage. It is placed throughout the layers around four different times in different places, locations, directions and opacity settings in order to provide a sense of cohesiveness and intention with the added shapes. </p>
