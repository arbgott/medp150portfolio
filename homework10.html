	<h2 class="HWname"> Liar Lair Pants on Fire</h2>
	<p class="parastatement"> When we were told to think of a topic and the data we wished to learn about, all I could think about were specific lies people told, and why. When it came down to it, asking about lies in general seemed to make the most sense. I am so glad that this is the direction I went with for this assignment becuase I had a lot of fun going through all of these submissions and learning about why and who people lie to. I also added some extra fun like "what is the last lie you told?" which were really funny, or it acted as place to alleviate some guilt they held about these lies; it all depended on the person submitting it. I learned a lot, and enjoyed conducting the research. I had a very clear image for how I wanted to chart the data and I'm very happy with how that came out as well. </p>
