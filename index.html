<h5 class="parastart"> Goals for Class: </h5>
<p class="parastatement"> As the semester comes to a close I felt that I should revise my goals for class that I outlined at the bigninning of the year. My web development skills have improved immesnsely and gotten me to a point where I am genuinely proud of my class site, and ferel it accurately represents a small portion of design skills. I was able to meet my goal of being fluent in HTML and I am gradually getting to the same level with CSS. I have gained a comprehensive understanding now of adobe photoshop and illustraitor and feel fortunate that I have gained another medium to create in. I am excited to further my knowledge of media design and creation next semester.  </p>

<h5 class="parastart"> Artists Statement: </h5>
<p class="parastatement"> As a previously established visual artist my intentions and motivations are already pretty clear in my mind. I use art to translate ideas and emotions that are important to me that I feel need to be expressed beyond words. I hope my degital art is just as compelling as my paintings and drawings and are in line with my pre-established artistic style of bright colors and deep, dark shadows. </p>
