<h2 class="parastart"> Homework 2 "How I Let Go of My Time-Management Anxiety" by Yohanca Delgado </h2>
	<p class="parastatement"> My concept of time changed greatly during the pandemic. At first the shift  to not having a  routine was nice; getting to do nothing with my day was a respite from the tedious structure of my high school class structure. As time went on however doing nothing and the lack of stimulation warped my sense of time and how it passes. Hours seemed to have gotten longer and longer. And then suddenly as life started to regain structure and I began working again- at school and at my retail job- life began to pick up pace and I was confused at how quick the day would get away from me. My concept of time is greatly reflected in my productivity and how I spent my time. This could be represented through photography if I took a photo wherever I was of whatever I was doing at the start of every hour of one day a month throughout my time in quarantine and during the semester online. At first there would be a lot of inactiveness and staying inside, but by March there would be a high contrast between my daily activities at the start of the pandemic and the midpoint that was march 2021. As I write this, I am reflecting on how I perceive time now versus the start and middle points of the pandemic. Life surly sped up; it feels as if I need to catch up on all the time missed/wasted alone in quarantine. If this photo project was real and I conducted it in September as well, it would show a great evolution  from where I began with never ending days spent in my childhood bedroom. </p>

<h2 class="parastart"> Homework 6 - "Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis" </h2>
	<p class="parastatement">I read all four stories within the Motherhood in Crisis series. I am choosing to focus on 'Heela: The School Girl 'My Stolen Future'. These illustrations vary from the images mainly because they take away a level of reality to them that make it easier to process these stories in a way that is more consumable for the reader and takes a lot of distraction away. When viewing pictures of Sierra Leone it is easy to let the fact that this is an entirely different country and culture take away from the severity of the situation. The disparity these women face is minimized when one sees the whole world as different from ours rather than theirs. So the fact that the illustrations are used over images help to make the point of these pieces unmissable. The illustration and the animation brought a new layer of depth to the story that is not often there with stories of inequality. As it illustrated these issues but accomplished this without causing a lack of relation between the viewer and the subject due to the difference in environment. Similarly, if there were no images and only text, or, no text and only images, a large portion of the story would be lost to the reader and the depth and severity of the situation would not have been noticed. The use of multimedia in this accomplishes a captivation of the audience that is necessary when trying to convey such an issue of importance like the lack of health care and rights the women of Sierra Leone face. </p>

<h2 class="parastart"> Homework 11 - "Workers in the Global South are making a living playing the blockchain game Axie Infinity" </h2>
	<p class="parastatement"> Axie Infinity is changing peoples lives in an extraordinary way I don't think anyone saw coming. This game isn't really a game at all but a place to trade NFTs. It couldn't have came about at a better time, and was able to help people maintain an income during the worst of the pandemic. It was hard to find my own conclusion on the topic while reading this article on Rest of the World because there is so much controversy surrounding NFT's going around as the world tries to understand them. It's hard to find a clear definition on what they are or how they are effecting the world/environment due to their complexity. There are plenty of moral dilemmas and questions that arose while I was reading this, questions like: how could this game not be wreaking havoc on the environment if NFTs are so bad? What is the end goal here? What makes these AXS and SLP's so valuable? 
<br>
	While the first two questions I have no answers for, I think that the value in the AXS and SLP's can be boiled down to this, there is only as much stock in them as you put in them, similar to crystals or zodiac signs. Someone told the masses that NFTs and crypto had value and suddenly they did. Aside from the obvious/immediate questions another qualm I noted as I read was what are the benefits these donors and game makers have? While the players are cashing out around 2,000 dollars a day I'm sure the higher ups at the game and the more established players are reaping much more. But why, and at what cost? There is much room for speculation, conspiracy, and accusation but it is beyond what I can grasp from just one article. However, these are important questions to ask about a new and trendy market and exactly why this article is the perfect place to start to gain a larger understanding and how to possibly gain from it your self. </p>
