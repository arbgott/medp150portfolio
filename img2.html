 <p class="parastatement"> This is my favorite photo I have taken in a long time. The composition originally was a little lacking because the background was too blurry for my liking as I wanted the people in the background to contruibute to the story. I like that the image tells a story of NYC in the pandemic and how the world is beginning to heal. As I was working with the image and cutting it up I began to realize how to use the histogram to my advantage. I noticed that bringing out the darks elevated the photo and made the other details stand out in comparison as I brought out their saturation. I used the cutting tool to bring out the details only where I wanted them. My perosnal taste is reflected in this image as well as in the first becuase I feel that the contrast of intense shadow and slightly increased saturation generates the most visual interest. </p>
