<p class="parastatement"> I try and take pictures to document my day to the best of my ability. I chose this picture because it was one of my favorites I got in the first week of school. I did not think about the crop portion of the assignment because I have to say the rest of the image is much more compelling and the whole thing is why I chose it, not just because of this crop. Once I cropped it, it lost a lot of its integrity but it did show the movement of the flag in a really nice way. I was using the same thought process I normally hold when I edit images on Iphone which is about as advanced in photo editing as I am. I like to give my photos just a bit more saturation as well as darken the shadows and lessen the highlights. I find this provides a more dramatic vibe for a photo and creates a lot of visual interest that way. </p>
